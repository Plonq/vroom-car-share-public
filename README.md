# Vroom Car Share

This is a basic car sharing system, similar to GoGet or GreenShareCar.
It was created as a final group project for [Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (OUA)](https://www.open.edu.au/courses/it/rmit-university-bachelor-of-information-technology--rmi-cpt-deg-2017).

You can see a live demo at https://vroom-car-share.herokuapp.com/. Feel free to create an account and try it out.
